[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/0ba0377d699a4a20a53829efe3e5d553)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/dynamiquel/Game-Bar-Browser?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=dynamiquel/Game-Bar-Browser&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

A basic web browser made for the Xbox Game Bar on Windows 10.

This web browser is really basic but one didn't exist for the Xbox Game Bar at the time, so it's better than nothing. I expect a superior web browser to appear in the coming months but this repo is open to suggestions.

## Installing older versions
To install an older version of Game Bar Browser, you must [**Sideload**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/bg126232(v=win.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) it.

1. Install the desired version
2. Right click on MSIX file

4. Click Digital Signatures
5. Select Signature from the list
6. Click Details
7. Click View Certificate
8. Click Install Certificate

## Developers
The app uses Microsoft's EdgeHTML WebView, and so inherits limitations and bugs from it. I also wouldn't say the code is worthy to fork, but do as you will.
