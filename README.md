# Game-Bar-Browser
A basic web browser made for the Xbox Game Bar on Windows 10.

This web browser is really basic but one didn't exist for the Xbox Game Bar at the time, so it's better than nothing. I expect a superior web browser to appear in the coming months but this repo is open to suggestions.

## Current features
- Access sites through URL address
- Access sites through a search engine (Bing, Google, DuckDuckGo)
- Home page
- Back a page
- Forward a page
- Refresh
- Pin to screen (part of Xbox Game Bar but it's still a pretty cool feature)
- Tabs

## Expected v2.0 features
- Bookmarks (Implemented)
- History
- URL Shortcuts (Implemented)
- Keyboard Shortcuts (Implemented, with some limitations)
- Full-screen support (Partially implemented)
- Open webpage in system's default browser (Implemented)
- Use browser without the Game Bar (Implemented)
- Access XAML Pages just like a webpage (Implemented)
- A huge refactor of existing code (Partially implemented)
- More search engines (Implemented)

## Developers
The app uses Microsoft's EdgeHTML WebView, and so inherits limitations and bugs from it. I also wouldn't say the code is worthy to fork, but do as you will.
