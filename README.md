A basic web browser made for the Xbox Game Bar on Windows 10.

This web browser is really basic but one didn't exist for the Xbox Game Bar at the time, so it's better than nothing. I expect a superior web browser to appear in the coming months but this repo is open to suggestions.

## Developers
The app uses Microsoft's EdgeHTML WebView, and so inherits limitations and bugs from it. I also wouldn't say the code is worthy to fork, but do as you will.
